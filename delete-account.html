<h4> <u>Deleting Your Account</u> </h4>

<p>To delete your account in the <i>Shopping Wizard</i> app, click the settings icon (that looks like a gear), and then choose <i>Delete Account</i>. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can send an email with the subject "Delete Account" to the following email address:

<a href= "mailto:bluecrabcrew@gmail.com">bluecrabcrew@gmail.com</a>.  Be sure to let us know either your Username within the app, or the email address associated with your Google Account.

</p>

<p>
    Once your account is deleted, all of the data we have stored for you will be permanently deleted, including:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Username</li>
        <li>Your List of Friends</li>
        <li>All of your Stores</li>
    </ul>
 <p>
    Note that if you previously shared any stores with friends, your friends will no longer be able to access them after your account is deleted.
</p>
 
 <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href= "mailto:bluecrabcrew@gmail.com">bluecrabcrew@gmail.com</a>.
